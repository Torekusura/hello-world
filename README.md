# hello-world
The beginning

Hello, I am 23 y/o programmer-aspirant with a bachelors degree in an unrelated field. 
I have studied java and mysql primarily on my own for the past half year along wit html,css, 
and python to a lesser extent. My goal is to make a career out of programming. 
While here I plan to expand my skills, help people(and receive help), and become a desirable employee through hard work.
I look foreward to programming challenges and working with people of all types.
